# Design Patterns

This repository contains implementations of various design patterns in Java.

## Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns provide ways to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using the new operator.

- [Factory Pattern](CreationalDesignPatter/01-FactoryPattern.java)
- [Abstract Factory Pattern](CreationalDesignPatter/02-AbstractFactoryPattern.java)
- [Builder Pattern](CreationalDesignPatter/03-BuilderPattern.java)
- [Singleton Pattern](CreationalDesignPatter/04-SingletonPattern.java)
- [Prototype Pattern](CreationalDesignPatter/05-PrototypePattern.java)

## Structural Design Patterns

_Coming soon..._

## Behavioral Design Patterns

Each file contains examples of the pattern implementation, including:

- Bad examples (without using the pattern)
- Good examples (proper implementation of the pattern)

More design patterns will be added in the future.
